2017-05-30 (Tuesday)
I finish the recursion unit within 2 - 3 days, from 2017-05-27 to 2017-05-30. I guess it is doing ok for a newbie.
I have finished most of the unit on the last Sunday, and I picked up the remaining revision part today.
Today is Dragon Boat Festival, and I felt sleepy after having sticky rice dumpling at around 2pm.
After surfing the web and taking a good holiday nap, I woke up at around 5pm to finish the rest.
I earned a JS Recursion badge after finishing this unit. It's kind of a gift to myself in celebration of the Dragon Boat Festival, which also signifies the official start of summer 2017.
Spending the summer to learn something new isn't bad at all.
